Chicken Tajine courtsey of Lex Chesler
======================================

1 lb chicken, your choice
olive oil
5 cloves of garlic, chopped
1 small onion sliced.
1 can chick peas
1 tbsp salt
1 tbsp ginger (approx, chopped fresh or ground)
1 tsp each of turmeric, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, black pepper
1.5 tbsp tomato paste (approx)
3 tbsp lemon juice (approx)
3/4 cup each raisins and sliced Kalamata olives. (approx)
1 cup chicken stock (approx)

So I did this in a pressure cooker (well, Instant Pot, actually), but you could just simmer for 1.5-2 hours if you don't have one.


1) Heat pan and add olive oil to just cover the bottom.

2) Add garlic, onion, and ginger (if fresh), saute until onions are soft.

3) Stir in chick peas, chicken, tomato paste and the rest of the spices.

4) Add enough chicken stock to 3/4 the level of the other ingredients (for pressure cooker, you might need a bit more if simmering).

5) Stir in enough raising and sliced olives so there is a good concentration throughout the mixture.

6) Add lemon juice to taste.

7) Instant Pot or pressure cooker to high for 25 minutes, natural release.  Or simmer until you're so hungry you can't stand it.

8) Serve over rice, garnish with cilantro, if desired.

9) Eat too much, pass out on couch.
